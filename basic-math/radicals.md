## Draw radicals on the number line

Pythagorean theorem states that $d^2 = a^2 + b^2$, where $d$ is the hypotenuse and $a, b$ are legs. 
The hypotenuse is then calculated as $d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

So if we can write the number under the square root as a sum of two perfect squares, we can then easily draw a right triangle, the hypotenuse of which will be the value of the radical.

Example: Draw $\sqrt{5}$ on the number line. <br>
We can write $\sqrt{5} = \sqrt{2^2 + 1^2}$. This makes a right triangle with legs of length 2 and 1, the hypotenuse of which will be of length $\sqrt{5}$.


Example: Draw $\sqrt{5} / 2$. <br>
We first draw $\sqrt{5}$ and then find the midpoint using a compass (draw a circle with same radius from both endpoints, the line through the intersection goes through the midpoint).

## Simplifying a radical expression

We can simplify radicals that are not perfect squares (1, 4, 9, ...) using the product rule of radicals.
First remember that $\sqrt{a * b} = \sqrt{a} * \sqrt{b}$.
Suppose we want to simplify the radical $\sqrt{z}$. We try to express $z$ as a product of two numbers, where one of those is a perfect square.

Example:
We can simplify $\sqrt{150}$ by writing the radical as $\sqrt{6 * 25} = \sqrt{6} * \sqrt{25}=5 * \sqrt{6}$.


We can use this knowledge to simplify radical expressions with multiple terms.
We do so by finding a common divisor of the radicals and then add the simplified terms.

Example: Simplify $\sqrt{12} + \sqrt{48} + \sqrt{75}$. <br>
We see that all numbers under the square roots are divisible by $3$.
So we can take out $\sqrt{3}$ from each term, resulting in $\sqrt{3} * (\sqrt{4} + \sqrt{16} + \sqrt{25})=\sqrt{3}*11$

## Rationalizing the denominator

### With one radical term in the denominator

Steps:

1.  Multiply both the numerator and denominator by a radical that will get rid of the radical denominator.
2.  Simplify all radicals
3.  Simplify the fraction

### With two terms in the denominator

1. Find the conjugate of the denominator. a + b and a - b are conjugates of each other.
2. Multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate.
3. Simplify all radicals
4. Simplify the fraction
